Venmo is a peer-to-peer mobile payments app that helps people send money instantly, for free. I worked on Venmo's Product Design team during the summer of 2014, working on Android, iOS, and web. We built a slew of new features and reduced design debt, while rewiring how the design team itself operates. Among other projects, I designed the new compose screens and the experience that integrates Venmo into <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com">Braintree</a>.

Designing for Venmo included a lot of exploratory features. Below are some concepts that were never released, including Multipay, Undo, an alternative send command, and Material Design mockups that later inspired the Android update.
