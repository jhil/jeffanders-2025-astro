MIDI Markup is a music markup language and synthesizer for visually impaired composers. After listening to talks at SXGood about accessibility and technology, we decided to focus our efforts on helping blind, and visually-impaired people in music.

I hacked on this project with [Stef Cohen](https://twitter.com/stefcohen3) and [Niko Lazaris](https://twitter.com/nikolazaris) at [SXSW Music Hackathon](https://www.sxsw.com/conference/sxsw-hackathon/).
