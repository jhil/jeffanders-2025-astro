Jam.dev is a tool for design markup and feedback where teams can seamlessly comment on local or production websites. I worked with Dani Grant and Itrefa Mohd to create the branding (logo, typography, and color) and first product design flows.

We also recorded a podcast episode together that you can listen to here: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5T6NULm5D5ZV9NSLMou6Of?si=21a933963e3f4a21&nd=1">100% Design by Jam.dev</a>.
